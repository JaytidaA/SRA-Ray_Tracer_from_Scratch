# Cherno's Tutorials
I am going through the YouTube videos of **The Cherno** about OpenGL and performing the programs which are performed by him.
## `Makefile` Usage
The `Makefile` is to be used as follows, make sure that the includes and libraries are present in the correct paths.
```bash
make <name-of-cpp-file-without-any-extensions>
```
